# greyhead_multisitemaker
Greyhead Multisite Maker lets you quickly spin up a Drupal multisite instance based on a particular installation profile. This code was originally developed to encourage non-technical people at a company I was contracting with to create a Drupal 7 site as easily as they would spin up a Wordpress site. As with everything I do, this is a work in progress, only works for my very narrow use-case, and will probably break the internet or something, so I wouldn't touch this code with a barge pole if I were you. Which I'm not, of course. I'm me. And now I'm confused...
